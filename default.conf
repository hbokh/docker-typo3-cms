### Begin: Compression via TYPO3 ###
#
# Compressing resource files will save bandwidth and so improve loading speed especially for users
# with slower internet connections. TYPO3 can compress the .js and .css files for you.
# *) Uncomment the following lines and
# *) Set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['compressionLevel'] = '9' for the Backend
# *) Set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['compressionLevel'] = '9' together with the TypoScript properties
#    config.compressJs and config.compressCss for GZIP compression of Frontend JS and CSS files.

# Enable gzip compression
gzip  on;

# Disable gzip compression for browsers that don't support it (in this case MS Internet Explorer
# before version 6 SV1).
#gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.(?!.*SV1)";

# Set the response header Vary: Accept-Encoding.
# Some proxies have a bug in that they serve compressed content to browsers that don't support it.
# By setting the Vary: Accept-Encoding header, you instruct proxies to store both a compressed and
# uncompressed version of the content.
gzip_vary on;

# Enables or disables gzipping of responses for proxied requests depending on the request and response.
gzip_proxied any;

# This tells nginx what file types to compress (text/html is always compressed)
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript application/javascript image/svg+xml;

# Add mime-type for compressed js files.
location ~ \.js\.gzip {
  types {
    text/javascript gzip;
  }
}

# Add mime-type for compressed css files.
location ~ \.css\.gzip {
  types {
    text/css css;
  }
}

### End: Compression via TYPO3 ###

### Begin: Browser caching of resource files ###

# Enable long browser caching for assets. This affects Frontend and Backend and increases performance.
location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|woff|ttf|svg|eot)$ {
  # etag is supported on nginx >= 1.3.3
  etag on;
  expires 1y;
}

### End: Browser caching of resource files ###

### Begin: Security ###
#
# Prevent information disclosure by blocking files possibly containing sensitive information.

# Block access to hidden" directories or files.
location ~ /\. {
  deny all;
  access_log off;
  log_not_found off;
}

# Block access files accidentally left on the server.
location (\.(bak|config|sql(\.zip|\.gz|\.bz2)?|ini|log|sh|inc|swp|t3d)|~)$ {
  deny all;
  access_log off;
  log_not_found off;
}

# Restrict access to deleted files in Recycler directories
location ~ ^/fileadmin/(.*/)?_recycler_/ {
  deny all;
  access_log off;
  log_not_found off;
}

# Restrict access to TypoScript files in default templates directories
location ~ ^/fileadmin/templates/.*(\.txt|\.ts)$ {
  deny all;
  access_log off;
  log_not_found off;
}

# Restrict access to Private extension directories
location ~ ^/typo3conf/ext/[^/]+/Resources/Private/ {
  deny all;
  access_log off;
  log_not_found off;
}

### End: Security ###

### Begin: Settings for url rewriting ###
#
# You need rewriting, if you use a URL-Rewriting extension like realurl or cooluri.

# Rule for versioned static files, configured through:
# - $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['versionNumberInFilename']
# - $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['versionNumberInFilename']
if (!-e $request_filename) {
  rewrite ^(.+)\.(\d+)\.(php|js|css|png|jpg|gif|gzip)$ $1.$3 last;
}

# Main URL rewriting
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
}

### End: Settings for url rewriting ###

### End: TYPO3 example configuration for NGINX ###
